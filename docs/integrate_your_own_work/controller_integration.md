# Integrate Your Own Controller

Since the specific steps might vary notably for different controllers, we do not provide a general tutorial illustrating the integration of a new controller.
For inspiration, please check the exhaustive examples for the [PID controller](../examples/long_example_pid.md) and the [MPC](../examples/long_example_mpc.md).
Therein, all the necessary steps for integrating these controllers and combining them with the CommonRoad reactive planner are described.
