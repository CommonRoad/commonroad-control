# Explanations

This chapter gives an overview on explanations of important concepts
regarding our simulation and vehicle dynamics.

We focus on the architecture and control theory
part here. For a detailed API documentation, refer to the [Core API chapter](../core_api/simulation/simulation.md).

If you do not have previous experience with kinematic and dynamic models, we recommend our [CommonRoad Vehicle Models script](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models/-/blob/master/vehicleModels_commonRoad.pdf?ref_type=heads) for getting started.
